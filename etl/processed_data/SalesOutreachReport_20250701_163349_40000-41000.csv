Founded in 1986 by Stephan Schertler, the company initially focused on amplification systems for double basses, leading to the development of the STAT-B microphone. Schertler has since expanded its product line to include modular and fixed-channel mixers, contact microphones for various acoustic instruments (guitar, violin, cello, mandolin, harp, piano, and bowed instruments), acoustic instrument amplifiers, and PA systems. Their product range includes series like Giulia, David, Jam, Unico, and Roy acoustic amps, Teddy and Elyps PA systems, and Charlie bass amplifiers. They also offer acoustic preamps such as Yellow Uno and Stat pre, along with the Arthur F48 modular mixer series.

The company emphasizes high fidelity sound reinforcement and a direct relationship with musicians. Schertler's business model combines distribution through partners with direct sales from their Swiss manufacturing plant. They are known for their Class-A preamps featuring No Negative Feedback (NNFB) technology, introduced in 2000. In recent years, Schertler has expanded into the pro audio sector with modular mixers and fixed-channel mixers.
